### About the project

[Link to project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

The weather app was a super fun project, I was tasked with using an API to grab the weatehr and its forecast, the correctly use and organize the data to display on the users screen.

The main object was to learn about API's and the basics asynchronous coding. I successfully uses try/catch as well as async and await functions. It was super fun and had a great time implementing them into this project!

### Objectives

- [x] Setup repository
- [x] Create an account for the weather API
- [x] Write code that can asynchronously grabs the data from the weather API by using a users input
- [x] Make sure that errors are handled correctly
- [x] Organize the fetched data
- [x] Use the data to correctly display the users requested location weather

### What I learned and What I would do differently

- This project was a great start to learn more about asynchronous coding and how it can be used in real life.
- I am sure that I will be using the methods that I learned in this project **a lot**, and I am overall super happy with my result.
- There is nothing really that I would do different, other than maybe take less time on this project (only because some personal matter)
